## Contextual Help System

### Overview
Every command generated by Shell Assist comes with comprehensive help information that includes:

- **Description**: Detailed explanation of what the command does and why it's useful
- **Parameters**: Key parameters and their purposes
- **Examples**: Example variations of the command
- **Risks**: Potential risks or side effects
- **Alternatives**: Alternative commands or approaches
- **Related Commands**: Related commands that might be useful
- **Risk Score**: Numerical assessment (0-10) with color coding

### Example Help Output

**User Input**: "show me disk usage"

**Generated Command**: `df -h`

**Risk Score**: 1/10 - Safe

**Help Information**:
- **Description**: Shows disk space usage for all mounted filesystems in human-readable format
- **Parameters**: `-h` flag displays sizes in human-readable units (KB, MB, GB)
- **Examples**: `df -h /home`, `df -h --total`
- **Risks**: None - read-only command
- **Alternatives**: `du -h` for directory-specific usage
- **Related Commands**: `du`, `lsblk`, `mount`

## Risk Scoring System

### Risk Levels

| Score | Level | Color | Description |
|-------|-------|-------|-------------|
| 0-2 | Safe | Green | Read-only commands, basic information |
| 3-4 | Low Risk | Yellow | File operations in user space |
| 5-6 | Medium Risk | Orange | System queries, network access |
| 7-8 | High Risk | Red | System modifications, package installs |
| 9-10 | Extreme Risk | Maroon | System-critical operations, data deletion |

### Risk Assessment Factors
The AI evaluates commands based on:
- **Command type**: Read-only vs destructive operations
- **Scope**: User space vs system-wide operations
- **Permissions**: Whether sudo is required
- **Data impact**: Potential for data loss
- **System impact**: Effects on system stability

### Visual Warnings
- **Color-coded risk levels** in both web and CLI interfaces
- **Animated warnings** for extreme risk commands (pulsing effect)
- **Prominent risk display** at the top of help sections
- **Detailed risk explanations** with specific dangers
